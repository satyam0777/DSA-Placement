## 💡 UNIQUE FEATURES IN THIS SHEET

### **Real-World Analogies for Each Pattern:**
- Pattern 1: "Walking through market counting items"
- Pattern 2: "Two friends meeting from opposite ends"
- Pattern 3: "Glass pane sliding over blocks"
- Pattern 4: "Bank account cumulative balance"
- Pattern 5: "Library index system"
- Pattern 7: "Keep track of best subarray so far"

These analogies help you **REMEMBER** when stressed in interview!

### **Complexity Comparisons:**
Not just "O(n² vs O(n))"... but real examples:
```
For 1000 queries on 10,000 element array:
Brute Force: 10,000,000 operations
Optimized:   11,000 operations
```

### **Interview Scripts:**
Exact dialogue showing:
- How to think out loud
- What to say when stuck
- How to handle questions
- Communication skills

### **Quick Reference Table:**
All 7 patterns in one table showing:
- When to use each
- Time/space
- Key insight

## 🎓 HOW TO USE THIS FOR INTERVIEW

### **Before Interview (1-2 weeks before):**
1. Read entire sheet (2-3 hours)
2. Understand each pattern's intuition
3. Memorize generic templates
4. Practice coding the templates

### **1 Week Before:**
1. Do 2-3 problems per pattern
2. Use sheet as reference (don't memorize code)
3. Practice explaining out loud

### **Night Before:**
1. Skim intuitions and flow structures
2. Remember 7 pattern names
3. Practice 1 problem per pattern

### **During Interview:**
1. Use pattern recognition immediately
2. Explain intuition (buy time, show thinking)
3. Use template as base
4. Code confidently
