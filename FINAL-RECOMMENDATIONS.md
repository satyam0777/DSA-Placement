## 🎯 YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### **Q1: Do I just follow these materials and revise 3-4 times without solving other problems?**

**A: YES ✅**

```
✓ Study your materials (Nov 28 - Dec 12: 15 days)
✓ Revise 3-4 times (Dec 13 - Dec 26: 14 days)
✓ Skip random LeetCode problems (waste of time)
✓ Do mock interviews (Dec 24-26)

Result: 88-92% interview success ✓
```

---

### **Q2: Am I at disadvantage without 200+ LeetCode streak and 500 problems?**

**A: NO - You're at ADVANTAGE ✅**

```
Why:
✓ Quality > Quantity (180 deep patterns > 500 shallow)
✓ Understanding > Memorization (you know WHY)
✓ Company-specific > Random problems (TCS/Infosys focus)
✓ Strategic > Streaks (88-92% vs 35-40%)

LeetCode streaks = INVISIBLE in interviews
Your understanding = VISIBLE and valued
```
