## 1. Why Linked List? When to Use?

###  Use Cases
- Implementing **stacks/queues** efficiently
- Real-world scenarios like **music playlist**, **browser history**, **LRU cache**

###  Why Not Array?
- Arrays have fixed size and need shifting on insert/delete
- LL offers **dynamic allocation** and no shifting needed

###  Think:
> "Am I inserting/deleting frequently in middle or front?"  
> Use LL. Otherwise, arrays are better.

---

## 2.  Singly vs Doubly Linked List

### Singly Linked List
- One direction traversal
- Less memory usage

### Doubly Linked List
- Can go back & forth
- Easier to delete a node without prev tracking

 Use DLL in:
- LRU Cache
- Undo-Redo operations

 Interview Tip: Know the **memory-time trade-off** when asked.

## 3.  Basic Operations (Insert/Delete/Search)

### A. Insert at Head
```cpp
Node* insertHead(Node* head, int val) {
    Node* temp = new Node(val);
    temp->next = head;
    return temp;
}
```

### B. Insert at Tail
- Traverse till `tail->next == NULL`
- Add new node

### C. Insert at Kth Position
- Traverse k-1 times, track prev
- Insert new node between prev and curr

### D. Delete by Value
- Use temp + prev node
- `prev->next = temp->next`
- Handle deleting head separately

### E. Search
- Simple linear traversal
- Return node if found or NULL

 Practice:
- Deleting 1st/last/middle node
- Replacing value at index

---

## 4. 🔁 Reverse a Linked List

### A. Iterative Reversal
- Track `prev`, `curr`, `next`
- Reverse `curr->next = prev`
- Move forward

### B. Recursive Reversal
```cpp
Node* reverse(Node* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return head;
    Node* newHead = reverse(head->next);
    head->next->next = head;
    head->next = NULL;
    return newHead;
}
```

 Interview Tip:
> Know both iterative and recursive versions  
> Recursive one is commonly asked for recursion testing

---

## 5.  Cycle Detection & Removal

### Detect Cycle
- Use two pointers: slow and fast
- If they ever meet, a cycle exists

```cpp
bool hasCycle(Node* head) {
    Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
        if (slow == fast) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Remove Cycle
1. Detect the cycle
2. Move one pointer to head
3. Move both by 1 until they meet = start of cycle
4. Break the loop before start

 Practice:
- Remove cycle completely
- Count number of nodes in cycle

---

## 6.  Middle of Linked List

### Two Pointer Trick
```cpp
Node* middle(Node* head) {
    Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }
    return slow;
}
```

### Use Cases
- Divide LL in two parts
- Palindrome check
- Binary Search on LL

 Tip: If even number of nodes, this returns 2nd middle

---

## 7.  Palindromic Linked List

### Steps:
1. Find middle using slow/fast
2. Reverse second half
3. Compare both halves

### Code Sketch:
```cpp
bool isPalindrome(Node* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return true;
    Node* mid = middle(head);
    Node* rev = reverse(mid);
    while (rev) {
        if (rev->val != head->val) return false;
        rev = rev->next;
        head = head->next;
    }
    return true;
}
```

 Don’t use array unless asked — use pointer logic in-place

---

## 8.  Intersection Point of Two Lists

### Naive:
- Use hash set of first list nodes, traverse second list and check in set

### Optimal:
1. Count lengths of both
2. Move pointer of longer list ahead by diff
3. Move both pointers until match

```cpp
Node* getIntersection(Node* a, Node* b) {
    int lenA = length(a), lenB = length(b);
    if (lenA > lenB) swap(a, b), swap(lenA, lenB);
    int diff = lenB - lenA;
    while (diff--) b = b->next;
    while (a && b && a != b) a = a->next, b = b->next;
    return a;
}
```

 Watch for cases where no intersection exists (return NULL)

## 9.  Advanced Patterns: Flattening, Sorting, Cloning

### A. Flatten a Multi-Level List
- Use recursion to flatten `child` list first
- Merge with `next`

 Related Problem: Flatten a multilevel doubly LL

### B. Sort Linked List
- Merge Sort is best (O(n log n)) for linked list

```cpp
Node* mergeSort(Node* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return head;
    Node* mid = getMiddle(head);
    Node* left = mergeSort(head);
    Node* right = mergeSort(mid);
    return merge(left, right);
}
```
