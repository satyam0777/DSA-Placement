## 12. More Advanced and Special Tree Concepts for Placements

---

### a. Tree Views (Top, Bottom, Left, Right)

- **Top View:** Nodes visible from the top when looking down.
- **Bottom View:** Nodes visible from the bottom.
- **Left/Right View:** Nodes visible from the left/right side.

**Pattern:**  
Use level order traversal with a map to track the first/last node at each horizontal distance.

---

### b. Vertical Order Traversal

- Print nodes column by column (vertical lines).
- Use a queue for level order and a map to group nodes by horizontal distance.

---

### c. Boundary Traversal

- Print all boundary nodes in anti-clockwise direction: left boundary, leaves, right boundary (in reverse).
- Combine three traversals: left boundary, leaves, right boundary.

---

### d. Zigzag/Spiral Level Order Traversal

- Level order but alternate left-to-right and right-to-left at each level.
- Use two stacks or a deque.

---

### e. Construct Tree from Traversals

- Given inorder and preorder/postorder, reconstruct the binary tree.
- Use recursion and index mapping.

---

### f. Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree

- Find the path with the maximum sum (can start and end at any node).
- Use postorder traversal and keep track of max sum at each node.

---

### g. Distance Between Two Nodes

- Find LCA, then compute distance from LCA to each node and sum.

---

### h. Print All Root-to-Leaf Paths

- Use recursion, keep a path vector, print when you reach a leaf.

---

### i. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

- Rearrange tree so it becomes a right-skewed linked list (in preorder).

---

### j. Symmetric Tree

- Check if left and right subtrees are mirror images.

---

### k. Children Sum Property

- For every node, node’s value = sum of its children’s values.

---

### l. Threaded Binary Tree (Advanced)

- Use unused left/right pointers to point to inorder predecessor/successor.

---

### m. AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, Segment Tree, Trie (Advanced)

- **AVL/Red-Black Tree:** Self-balancing BSTs for guaranteed O(log n) operations.
- **Segment Tree:** For range queries and updates.
- **Trie:** For efficient prefix-based search (strings).

---

### n. Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)

- Efficient for prefix sum and update queries on arrays.

---

### o. Tree Diameter (Longest Path) Between Any Two Nodes

- Already covered, but remember:  
  - Can be solved in O(N) with a single postorder traversal.

---

### p. Morris Traversal (O(1) Space Traversal)

- Inorder traversal without stack or recursion, using threaded binary tree concept.

---

**Summary:**  
These advanced and special tree concepts are frequently asked in interviews.  
Focus on understanding the pattern, drawing the tree, and practicing recursive and iterative approaches.  
For each, try to solve with both code and dry-run examples.
