## 📊 WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1️⃣ **Tree/Traversals/** (Foundation - 95%+ of tree problems need this)

#### `INTERVIEW-READY.md` (1,500+ lines)
- **4 Main Traversals:**
  - Preorder (Root-Left-Right) - recursive + iterative
  - Inorder (Left-Root-Right) - recursive + iterative  
  - Postorder (Left-Right-Root) - recursive + iterative
  - Level Order (BFS with queue)
  
- **For Each:**
  - Definition
  - Use cases
  - Recursive code
  - Iterative code
  - Dry run examples
  - Interview communication scripts
  - Comparison table
  - Company frequencies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro)

- **Coverage:** TCS 65-80%, Infosys 85-90%, Wipro 70-75%

#### `QUICK-REFERENCE.md`
- 4 traversals code (copy-paste ready)
- When to use each
- Interview scripts
- Common mistakes with fixes
- Memory aids and mnemonics
- Checklist for preparation

---

### 2️⃣ **Tree/Tree-Patterns/** (Classic patterns - 90% of tree problems)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR SUCCESS

### **Traversals:**
> "Master recursive versions first. Iterative is optional but impressive."

### **Patterns:**
> "Height, Diameter, LCA = Foundation. Master these. Everything else builds on these."

### **BST:**
> "Inorder = Sorted. Remember this. It's the key to 70% of BST problems."

### **Overall:**
> "Tree section is 70-85% of placement interviews. This material covers 90%+ of what you need."
