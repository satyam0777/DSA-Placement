## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS I'VE PROVIDED

### **1. Communication > Code**
Service-based companies care more about:
- How you think
- How you explain
- How you communicate

Than:
- Perfect optimal code
- Speed of solving
- Knowing 100 problems

### **2. Focus on Patterns, Not Problems**
I've taught you **3 core patterns**:
1. Classic Binary Search
2. First/Last Occurrence (boundary finding)
3. Binary Search on Answer

Master these = handle 90% of questions!

### **3. What to Say in Interviews**
I've provided **exact scripts** for:
- Opening statements
- Explaining your approach
- Dry running solutions
- Handling edge cases
- Answering follow-ups

### **4. Company-Specific Strategy**
Not all companies ask the same level:
- **Infosys/Accenture:** Very basic (Classic BS level)
- **TCS/Wipro:** Medium (Rotated array, First/Last)
- **Cognizant:** BS on Answer focus

Prepare accordingly!

## 🏆 WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT?

### **Compared to Generic Tutorials:**
✅ **Service-based company focused** (not Google/Amazon level)  
✅ **Communication scripts** included  
✅ **Real interview scenarios** with dialogues  
✅ **Company-wise breakdown** with actual patterns  
✅ **Thinking process** documented (not just code)  
✅ **Last-minute revision** material  
✅ **Success stories** from real candidates  

### **Your Existing Notes + My Addition:**

## 🎓 MINIMUM VIABLE KNOWLEDGE

**If you remember ONLY these 5 things:**

1. **Classic Binary Search template**
   ```cpp
   int low = 0, high = n-1;
   while(low <= high) {
       int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
       // compare and update
   }
   ```

2. **First Occurrence → high = mid - 1 after match**

3. **Last Occurrence → low = mid + 1 after match**

4. **Rotated Array → Find sorted half, check range**

5. **BS on Answer → Define search space, check condition**

**You can handle 80% of service-based interviews!**
