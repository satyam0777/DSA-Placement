## 🎯 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

### **Day 1: DP Foundations (2 hours)**

✅ **DP-Concepts/FOUNDATIONS.md**
- What is Dynamic Programming?
- Why overlapping subproblems matter
- Memoization (top-down recursive)
- Tabulation (bottom-up iterative)
- When to use DP (2 necessary conditions)
- State transition formula (define → relation → base → build)
- Space optimization introduction

✅ **Easy-Patterns Introduction (30 min)**
- Read through Pattern 1 (Fibonacci)
- Understand progression: recursive → memoization → tabulation → space-optimized

**Output:** You understand DP philosophy and have seen one complete example

---

### **Day 2: Easy Patterns Mastery (2.5 hours)**

✅ **Easy-Patterns/INTERVIEW-READY.md**
- Pattern 1: Fibonacci - O(n), O(1)
- Pattern 2: Climbing Stairs - Same recurrence as Fibonacci!
- Pattern 3: Coin Change - Minimum coins problem
- Pattern 4: House Robber - Choose/skip decision tree

**Time breakdown:**
- Fibonacci: 30 min (read + code)
- Climbing Stairs: 20 min (similar pattern)
- Coin Change: 45 min (new concept)

  - 60 min (spend extra time here!)
  - Understand reverse loop trick
  - Why 0/1 (each item taken 0 or 1 time)
  
- Pattern 2: Longest Increasing Subsequence
  - 45 min
  - O(n²) approach (not binary search)
  
- Pattern 3: Longest Common Subsequence
  - 45 min
  - Similar structure to edit distance
  
- Pattern 4: Edit Distance
  - 45 min
  - 3 operations: delete, insert, replace

**Output:** 4 medium patterns, ready for real interviews

2. **Day 2:** 4 Easy patterns (2.5h) + Practice coding (1h)
3. **Day 3:** 4 Medium patterns (3h) + 0/1 Knapsack extra review (1h)

### **Total Time:**
- Reading: 5.5 hours
- Coding practice: 2-3 hours
- **Total: 7-8.5 hours for 3 days** ✓

### **Recommended Schedule:**
- Day 1 (Dec 10): 2.5h morning + 1h evening
- Day 2 (Dec 11): 3h morning + 1h evening
- Day 3 (Dec 12): 4h morning + practice evening

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS SUMMARY

### **Easy Patterns:**
```
Fibonacci      = fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)     [O(n) time, O(1) space]
Stairs         = stairs(n) = stairs(n-1) + stairs(n-2)  [Same as Fib!]
Coin Change    = Try each coin, pick minimum        [INT_MAX handling critical]
House Robber   = max(rob[i-2] + money, rob[i-1])   [Choose or skip]
```

### **Medium Patterns:**
```
0/1 Knapsack   = Include/exclude decision per item [Reverse loop trick!]
LIS            = Check all j<i with nums[j]<nums[i] [O(n²) approach]
LCS            = Match chars, extend or skip        [2D DP classic]
Edit Distance  = 3 operations: delete, insert, replace [Transformation]
```

## ⭐ MUST-KNOW PATTERNS

### **Tier 1 (Critical):**
- ✅ 0/1 Knapsack (70-85% of medium DP, core algorithm)
- ✅ Coin Change (70-85% of easy DP, transformation)

### **Tier 2 (Important):**
- ✅ LCS (60-75% of medium DP, subsequence)
- ✅ Edit Distance (50-70% of medium DP, transformation)

### **Tier 3 (Good to Know):**
- ✅ LIS (55-80% medium DP, pattern finding)
- ✅ House Robber (70% easy DP, decision tree)

---

## 🎓 PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Day 1-2 (Easy Practice):**
```
Fibonacci: Code 5-10 times (repetition for muscle memory)
Stairs: Code once (same pattern)
Coin Change: Code 3-5 times (INT_MAX handling tricky)
House Robber: Code 2-3 times (choose/skip pattern)
```

### **Day 3 (Medium Practice):**
```
Knapsack: Code 5-10 times (MOST IMPORTANT)
LCS: Code 2-3 times
Edit Distance: Code 2-3 times
LIS: Code 2 times (hardest to come up with)
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DON'Ts

```
❌ DON'T memorize without understanding state transition
❌ DON'T skip base cases (causes infinite loop/wrong answer)
❌ DON'T forget reverse loop in knapsack (item reuse bug)
❌ DON'T use forward loop for 0/1 knapsack
❌ DON'T initialize DP without clear values
❌ DON'T assume integer types (overflow with INT_MAX)
❌ DON'T skip edge cases (n=0, n=1, empty arrays)
```
