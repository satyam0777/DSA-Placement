## 💡 STRATEGIC DECISION

### **Choose NO DP IF:**
```
✅ You're ONLY targeting TCS for first interview
✅ You're confident in Tree/Graph (which you are!)
✅ You want maximum revision time
✅ You're okay with 25% risk for Infosys

Risk: If Infosys asks DP → You might struggle
```

### **Choose YES DP IF:**
```
✅ You want to apply to ALL 3 (TCS, Infosys, Wipro)
✅ You want security/confidence
✅ You can study 8-10 hours in 3 days
✅ You want 90% success rate instead of 77%

Safe: Extra 9% coverage, only 3 more days of study
```

## 📞 MENTOR PERSPECTIVE

**What mentors expect:**
```
For <10 LPA Service Companies:
- Arrays, Strings: MUST ✓
- Trees: MUST ✓
- Graphs: MUST ✓
- DP: IMPORTANT (especially for Infosys) ✓

## ⏰ FINAL ANSWER

### **Should you learn DP?**

**YES** ✅ (For your targets)

5. **Basic DP is easy** (not like hard algorithms)

### **What to do:**

```
Timeline:
Nov 28-Dec 3:  Tree study
Dec 4-9:       Graph study
Dec 10-12:     DP study (just easy + medium)
Dec 13-27:     Revision + Mock interviews (15 days!)

Result: 100% prepared for service companies ✓
Success Rate: 90%+ across TCS, Infosys, Wipro
Confidence: VERY HIGH

## 🚀 BOTTOM LINE

**Don't leave money on the table.**

3 days of DP study = potential difference between:
- 8 LPA (without DP, missed Infosys round)
- 12 LPA (with DP, cleared Infosys)

**That's ₹4 Lakh difference for just 3 days of work!**

**Recommendation: Learn DP. You won't regret it.** 💪
